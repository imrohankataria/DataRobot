# DataRobot

This repository is dedicated to my efforts in translating DataRobot 10x Applied Data Science Academy's Class Labs to R-Code. My motivation behind is to explore the usage of the DataRobot AutoML Platform with R and perform operations using the official API and [r-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datarobot/datarobot.pdf).

## Status
This repository is still under development. Continuing changes in the README and Content.
